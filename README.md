# Opus

Opus is a Redis-like in-memory cache system implemented in C++. It provides a lightweight and efficient solution for in-memory data storage and caching.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- Make build system

### Build Instructions
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Subhadeep-coder/opus.git
cd opus

# Build the project
make

# Run the program
make run

# Clean build files
make clean
```

## Current Features
- Multi-user authentication system
- YAML-based configuration
- Command-line interface basics

## Development
The project uses a Makefile-based build system. All source files should be placed in the `src` directory. The build system will automatically detect and compile new source files.

## Build System

### Build Artifacts
During the build process, several types of files are generated:

- **`.o` (Object files)**: 
  - Compiled source files before linking
  - Created for each `.cpp` file
  - Contains machine code but not yet executable
  - Example: `main.cpp` → `main.o`

- **`.d` (Dependency files)**: 
  - Generated by compiler (`-MMD -MP` flags)
  - Track header dependencies for each source file
  - Help Make rebuild files when headers change
  - Example: `main.cpp` → `main.d`

### Build Process
1. Compiler generates `.o` and `.d` files from `.cpp` sources
2. Linker combines `.o` files into final executable
3. Dependency files ensure correct rebuilds when headers change
